            <div class="div1">Variables in CSS are most useful when we need to apply the same rules over and over again for multiple elements, e.g. the repeating colors in a theme. Instead of copy-and-pasting every time we want to reuse the same color, we can place it in a variable and access it from there ,Now, if our client doesn't like the shade of blue we've chosen, we can alter the styles in just one place (the definition of our variable) to change the colors of the whole theme. Without variables we would have to manually search and replace for every single occurrence, For this demo to work properly make sure you are using one of these browsers.
